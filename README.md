# Kawase blur and gauss blur on chessboard using metal
This project is based on Apple's sample code named "Customizing Render Pass Setup"
---

## How it's working
- Image is picked from file and converted to texture
- Texture from file is rendered to screen
- Kawase pass is applied in loop iteration and its going through all passes
- Both passes are working for each other's save and load
- Texture is presented to screen view
